A planar homography is an warp operation (which is a mapping from pixel
coordinates from one camera frame to another) that makes a fundamental assumption of the
points lying on a plane in the real world. Under this particular assumption, pixel coordinates
in one view of the points on the plane can be directly mapped to pixel coordinates in another
camera view of the same points.
